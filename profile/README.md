# PartCAD

## Intro

We are a vibrant community of CAD engineers, mechanical, electrical, and software engineers.
We are from all walks of life: hobbyists, self-employed professionals, and corporate employees.
We're inspired beginners who are just joining this space and
tech industry veterans with tenure at companies such as Google, Apple, Uber, and Tesla.

We are here to revolutionize the stagnating design and manufacturing industries
by boosting human efficiency and enabling the use of AI in all phases of the product life cycle,
resulting in a dramatic reduction of time-to-market.

Today (written on Nov 20th, 2024), in software engineering, anyone can build a complete mobile app using AI.
Imagine we transfer these achievements to mechanical and electrical engineering.
Now, with PartCAD we connect bits to atoms so that you can use AI to design complete hardware products
(like bespoke furniture, new robots, custom houses), and make it ready for manufacturing and assembly.

We are open-source to disrupt the market by offering radically low prices and risks,
to be the default go-to option for all CAD and PLM needs in the 2nd quarter of the 21st century.
